## What's Inside

A single-file dashboard (`index.html`) that brings together everything needed to explore, filter, and export employee data — no build step, no dependencies to install, just open and go.

```
📁 factwise-dashboard/
└── 📄 index.html        ← entire app lives here
```

## Features

**Grid**
- Client-side AG Grid with 12 columns of rich employee data
- Column sorting, resizing, and reordering out of the box
- Pinned `Employee` column so names stay in view while scrolling
- Custom cell renderers for every column — no raw text anywhere

**Filters**
- Live search across name, email, position, location, department, and manager
- Department dropdown filter
- Active / Inactive status filter
- All three filters compose together in real time
- KPI cards update dynamically as you filter

**KPI Summary Bar**
- Total employees · active vs inactive split
- Average salary across visible records
- Average performance rating
- Total projects completed
- Department and office location count

**Export**
- One-click CSV export via AG Grid's native API

**Design**
- Dark navy theme extracted directly from `factwise.io`
- Teal `#00c49a` accent — the FactWise brand colour
- Inter font, tabular numerals, tight letter-spacing
- Department colour-coded badges and avatar initials
- Glowing green dot for active status
- Performance bar that shifts green → teal → amber by score

## Dataset

20 employees across 5 departments — Engineering, Marketing, Sales, HR, and Finance — spanning 6 US cities. Each record includes:

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `id` | number |
| `firstName` / `lastName` | string |
| `email` | string |
| `department` | string |
| `position` | string |
| `salary` | number |
| `hireDate` | ISO date string |
| `age` | number |
| `location` | string |
| `performanceRating` | float (0–5) |
| `projectsCompleted` | number |
| `isActive` | boolean |
| `skills` | string[] |
| `manager` | string \| null |

---

## Scaling to Real Data

The grid is configured for client-side rendering — swap the inline `employees` array for a `fetch()` call and nothing else changes:

```js
// Replace this:
const employees = [ /* hardcoded */ ];

// With this:
const response = await fetch('https://your-api.com/employees');
const employees = await response.json();
```

For datasets beyond ~10,000 rows, enable AG Grid's Server-Side Row Model by changing one option:

```js
rowModelType: 'serverSide'
```

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Grid | AG Grid Community 31.3.2 | Fastest client-side grid available |
| Runtime | Vanilla JS (ES2020) | Zero framework overhead |
| Fonts | Inter via Google Fonts | Matches FactWise product typography |
| Icons | Inline SVG | No icon font dependency |
| Styles | Plain CSS with custom properties | Easy to theme, no preprocessor needed |

---

## Customisation

All colours live in `:root` CSS variables at the top of the file — change the theme in one place:

```css
:root {
  --fw-bg:    #0a0e1a;   /* page background   */
  --fw-teal:  #00c49a;   /* primary accent     */
  --fw-text:  #f1f5f9;   /* primary text       */
}
```

Adding a new column is one object in `columnDefs`:

```js
{
  headerName: 'Your Column',
  field: 'yourField',
  minWidth: 120,
  cellRenderer: ({ value }) => `<span>${value}</span>`
}
```
